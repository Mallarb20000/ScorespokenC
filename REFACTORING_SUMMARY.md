```
├── types/           # Comprehensive TypeScript definitions
├── config/          # Test configurations and question banks  
├── state/           # Reducer-based state management
├── services/        # Business logic services
├── hooks/           # Custom hooks for complex logic
└── index.ts         # Barrel exports
```

### **Shared Components (`src/components/shared/`)**
```
├── TestInterface.tsx      # Unified test component (configurable)
├── QuestionDisplay.tsx    # Question + TTS + progress
├── RecordingControls.tsx  # Audio recording with modes
├── SubmissionPanel.tsx    # Navigation + submission
└── index.ts               # Barrel exports
```

### **Services Architecture**
```
├── AudioService.ts        # Recording + playback + beeps
├── TTSService.ts          # Text-to-speech with fallbacks  
├── SubmissionService.ts   # Retry logic + error recovery
```
