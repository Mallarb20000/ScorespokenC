# ScoreSpoken MVP Roadmap

## Current Status: 60% to MVP
**Architecture:** Excellent foundation with 95% code reduction achieved  
**Core Features:** All 4 IELTS test types working with AI analysis  
**Next Focus:** User management and production infrastructure

## MVP Readiness Assessment

### ✅ **Ready for 10 Concurrent Users:**
- Hybrid storage system (memory + Supabase) working
- Server handles concurrent requests without crashing
- Comprehensive file validation implemented
- Clean architecture with centralized state management

### ❌ **Critical Gaps:**
- No authentication system
- No user isolation or rate limiting  
- No database for user data/history
- No error monitoring

## Strategic Priorities

### **Immediate Next Actions:**
1. **Complete Firebase Auth** (Step 2) - Enables user isolation
2. **Database setup** (Step 3) - Core persistence layer
3. **Rate limiting** (Step 4) - Cost protection

### **Success Factors:**
- Focus on user retention through progress tracking
- Monitor AI costs closely (can scale unexpectedly)
- Start with single paid tier, expand later
- Use Firebase ecosystem for integration benefits

### **Timeline:** 6-8 weeks to production-ready MVP
### **Market Opportunity:** High - IELTS prep users pay well for AI feedback
