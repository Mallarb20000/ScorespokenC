# Scorespoken: An AI-Powered Speaking Assessment Tool

This project is a prototype of an AI-powered system designed to analyze spoken English and provide an estimated proficiency score, similar to those used in standardized tests like IELTS. It aims to provide language learners with an accessible, on-demand tool to practice their speaking skills.

## The Problem I'm Solving

For millions of non-native English speakers, practicing for the speaking component of proficiency tests is a major challenge due to:
* **High Cost:** Tutors and classes can be expensive.
* **Speaking Anxiety:** Practicing with a person can be stressful.
* **Lack of Access:** It's difficult to find qualified partners for practice.

Scorespoken aims to address these issues by creating a free and automated feedback tool.

## How It Works (Conceptual Architecture)

The system is designed as an AI pipeline that processes user-submitted audio:

1.  **Audio Input:** The user records themselves speaking on a specific topic.
2.  **Speech-to-Text:** The audio file is transcribed into text using a speech recognition API (e.g., Google's Gemini API).
3.  **Feature Extraction:** The system analyzes both the audio and the text to extract key features related to language proficiency, such as:
    * **Fluency:** Pace of speech, number and length of pauses.
    * **Pronunciation:** (Future goal) Analyzing phonemes against a standard model.
    * **Vocabulary:** Lexical diversity and use of less common words.
    * **Grammar:** Analyzing sentence structure from the transcribed text.
4.  **Scoring Model:** These features are fed into a model which calculates an estimated band score.

## Technologies & Concepts

* **Primary Language:** Python
* **Core Fields:** Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* **APIs & Tools:** Currently exploring Google's Gemini API for advanced speech and language analysis.

## Project Status

This is an ongoing personal R&D project. The current focus is on building a reliable pipeline for feature extraction from audio inputs.
